# Model-Based-Deep-Learning-for-Low-Cost-IMU-Dead-Reckoning-of-Wheeled-Mobile-Robot
Code of article ["Model-Based Deep Learning for Low-Cost IMU Dead-Reckoning of Wheeled Mobile Robot"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10219182/algorithms#algorithms).

# Code
Our implementation is done in Python 3.8. We use Pytorch for the adapter block of the system. 

More detailed installation and usage instructions will be coming soon.
